# cs453-compiler

This was my project when I took the cs-453 compiler class at University of Arizona in 2010 from professor Saumya Debray.

## C--

The langauge compiled is called C-- because it is a subset of C (like how C++ is a superset of C). The scanner and parser are a combination of lex and yacc and the compiled code is mips assembly. It can handle reading in nd printing out integers & strings as well as conditionals, loops, function calls and even recursion. That means, interestingly enough, that the langauge is turing complete and it's possible to write a basic turing machine in it (trust me I did!).
